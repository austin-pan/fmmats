# LibFM Matrix Generator Helper

A Python library to simplify the creation of files needed for Stephen Rendle's LibFM in relational contexts.

## Installation

This library hasn't been added to PyPI yet so you can't install without cloning this repo yet.

To manually install the library, you can run the following.
```
git clone git@github.com:austin-pan/fmmats.git

cd fmmats
pip install .
```
You can use the `-e` flag for personal realtime development on the library, i.e.

```
pip install -e .
```
